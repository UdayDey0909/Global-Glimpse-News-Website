      <br /><br />

        The Service is provided to You &quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS
        AVAILABLE&quot; and with all faults and defects without warranty of any

        respect to the Service, including all implied warranties of
        merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and
        non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of
        dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice. Without
        limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or
        undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the Service

        company's provider makes any representation or warranty of any kind,

        Service, or the information, content, and materials or products included
        thereon; (ii) that the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free;
        (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any information or
        content provided through the Service; or (iv) that the Service, its

      <p>
        Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of

        applicable law.
